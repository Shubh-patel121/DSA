/* 
A tree is a non-linear data structure that represents a hierarchical structure of elements.
It consists of nodes connected by edges, where each node has a value and zero or more child nodes.
Trees are widely used in computer science and software development for organizing and managing data
in a hierarchical manner.

 ## Types of Trees - 

1.Binary Tree:- A binary tree is a tree in which each node has up to two child nodes (left and right).

2.Binary Search Tree (BST):- A binary tree where each node's left child has a value less than the node,
  and each right child has a value greater than the node.

3.AVL Tree:- A self-balancing binary search tree where the heights of the left and right subtrees of each node differ by at most one.

4.Red-Black Tree: Another self-balancing binary search tree with additional color properties to maintain balance.

5.B-Tree: A self-balancing tree often used in databases and file systems. It is a multi-level, multi-child tree structure.

6.Trie: A tree-like data structure used to store strings, with each node representing a single character.

7.Segment Tree: A tree data structure that allows for efficient range queries and updates.


## Practical Applications of Trees -

1.Hierarchical Data: Trees are commonly used to represent hierarchical data such as organizational charts, file systems, and classification systems.

2.Searching and Sorting: Binary search trees and other tree-based structures provide efficient searching and sorting capabilities.

3.Autocomplete and Spellcheck: Tries are used in autocomplete and spellcheck applications to efficiently store and search for strings.

4.Range Queries: Segment trees can efficiently handle range queries and updates in array data.
