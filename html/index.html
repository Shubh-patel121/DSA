     <!-- The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag: -->
     <!-- Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element).
          These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag! -->

          <!-- The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag: -->

    <!-- 
        All HTML elements can have attributes
        -> attributes are in key value pair and always prefer lowercase , and value should be inside quote, without quote also it will work but prefer best practices
        There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:

        1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website.
           Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it,
           you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images;
           it can suddenly be removed or changed.
        2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website.
           Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, 
           it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg".
           If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain.
           Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".
        
        Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.

        -> The href attribute of <a> specifies the URL of the page the link goes to
        -> The src attribute of <img> specifies the path to the image to be displayed
        -> The width and height attributes of <img> provide size information for images
        -> The alt attribute of <img> provides an alternate text for an image
        -> The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more
        -> The lang attribute of the <html> tag declares the language of the Web page
        -> The title attribute defines some extra information about an element, 
           it will be displayed when we hover over the element, its a tooltip.

        HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
        <h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading.

      <!-- 
        The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph.
        A paragraph always starts on a new line, 
        and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.
       -->
       <!-- 
        With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
        The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed:

        <!-- 
        Horizontal rule set    
        The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
        The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:
        
        line break.
        Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:

        hr and br are empty elements.
        -->
        <!-- 
        The HTML <pre> element defines pre-formatted text.
        The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier),
        and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:
         -->
         <!-- 
            <p>	Defines a paragraph
            <hr>	Defines a thematic change in the content
            <br>	Inserts a single line break
